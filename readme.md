This repository contains a Wordpress theme for a tutorials website to help design students with learning electronics to build awesome interactive intelligent products and services at the faculty of Industrial Design Tu/e.

## Design goal
Students often come to expert staff with two questions.
* How can I build this?
* Which component do I need?

With the website we aim to provide an information platform for students to easily find an answer to these two questions by themselves.

For both questions we've created a custom taxonomy allowing us to build specific index pages, a search system and links between pages.

### Tutorials taxonomy
Tutorials guide students through a complete electronics project.

### Components taxonomy
Component pages describe specific parts such as resistors, transistors and LEDs.

### Activity taxonomy
Next to these two content types there is also a taxonomy for activities. This allows educators to create custom content for educational activities such as courses, workshops, hackathons and possibly other things.
